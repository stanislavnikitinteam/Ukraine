				<p class="main__desc1">The team at Waites has been shocked by Russia's actions in Ukraine. Given our
					significant presenceÂ in that country, we think it's important for us to speak out publicly about
					this unlawful and unprecedented aggression.</p>
				<p class="main__desc2">For more than a decade, Waites has had an extensive presence in Kherson, Ukraine.
					Dozens of our valued coworkers and friends are located there. Our entire European operation is run
					out of our office inÂ Kherson. While our team has grown there, it has been so inspiring to watch the
					development of Ukraine into a modern, technologically advanced country with highly talented people
					doing important workâ€”for our company and so many others. I have been proud of our team and what we
					have built there, but I have also been proud of the country of Ukraine as it has blossomed in the
					modernÂ world.</p>
				<p class="main__desc3">Ukrainians ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ have already demonstrated their courage and strength in defending
					their homeland and the very principles of civilized, democratic life in Europe. Ukraine is fighting
					off a Russian invasion and defending their lives and their freedom. Right now, Russia continues
					waging a war and ðŸ’£ attacking Ukrainian cities by land, air, and sea.</p>
				<p class="main__desc4">We are asking you to stand with the people of Ukraine against the Russian actions
					inÂ Ukraine.</p>
				<p class="main__desc5">We ask you to stand with us. Please support Ukraine by lobbying your government,
					protesting peacefully, and donating money to support the people of Ukraine. Please do what you can
					and share these links with your colleagues, friends, and community. Every contribution helps the
					struggling people of Ukraine.</p>
